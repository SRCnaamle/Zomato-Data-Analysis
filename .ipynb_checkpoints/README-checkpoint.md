# Zomato-Data-Analysis
## Zomato Data Analysis Using Python

This project is analysing the sales data from Zomato. It explores different aspects of the data, such as the ratio of online vs offline orders, restaurant ratings, locations, and cuisines. The analysis includes operations like data cleaning, handling missing values, and detecting duplicates. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed using visualisation techniques such as bar plots, box plots, and heatmaps to uncover trends and patterns. Pivot tables are created to analyse relationships between attributes like online ordering and restaurant categories. The goal is to extract valuable insights that can assist restaurant owners and stakeholders in making data-driven decisions.
